TO RUN:

Have 2 terminal sessions, one for client side and one for server side.
On serverside, you will have to use the command uvicorn main:app --reload

On clientside, run the command npm install and then npm start.

For both of these, you will need the .env files, I can send them via email
to professors if needed, since it is using my own database.
